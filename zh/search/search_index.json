Access tokens \u2693\ufe0e If you had the chance to look at your account settings at FreeFlarum , you might've already noticed that there is a section where all of your access tokens are listed. Access tokens are created on every successful login to your FreeFlarum forum account. They can be used by outside parties to perform actions on behalf of your account (e. g.: download your forum data, link your domain, fixup your forum, get your forum information, etc...). The main idea is that you may provide third party migration services with one of your access tokens, and they can fetch your forum data and migrate your forum for you. Or, you might simply want to create a personal script to link your domain under certain conditions, for example. All API routes are listed at https://api.freeflarum.com/ . Access tokens with \"elevated permissions\" \u2693\ufe0e Access tokens that have \"elevated permissions\" are created only when you log in to FreeFlarum via its main website ( https://freeflarum.com ).

However, if you copy a token with elevated permissions and use it outside of FreeFlarum, it will still have elevated permissions. It is recommended that you provide third-party services with normal tokens. \"Remember me\" \u2693\ufe0e By default, the \"Remember me\" box is not ticked when logging in to FreeFlarum, and so your access token will expire in 1 hour. This is recommended for one-time third-party services (if they finish the task within 1 hour), so that the token is no longer valid after 1 hour. If you tick the \"Remember me\" box, the token is then valid forever (in other words, you won't be logged out unless the access_token cookie is deleted, e. g.: after clearing browsing history). Creating new access tokens \u2693\ufe0e You have 2 options to create access tokens: Log in through FreeFlarum's website; Send an API request to https://api.freeflarum.com/authentication . The first method is ideal if you can't create an API request or you simply aren't a technical type, but need the access token for some third-party service. To do it this way while staying logged in via your main token, open a new private browsing/incognito session or visit FreeFlarum through a different browser/device. Then, log in without ticking the \"Remember me\" box, and you will have a temporary (1 hour) token, with elevated permissions though. If you don't want elevated permissions, then you will either need to authenticate via api.freeflarum.com or forge an API request. The second method is ideal for obtaining tokens without elevated permissions, and is described in the API documentation . Revoking access tokens \u2693\ufe0e Again, you have 2 options: Log in to FreeFlarum.com and revoke it by clicking the trash bin icon on the left of the access token; Use access token with elevated permissions and send an API request. Please note that changing your forum admin's password won't revoke existing access tokens (this is due to technical limitations - FreeFlarum's Python backend can't communicate with Flarum's PHP backend easily). If you change your password because of security reasons (e. g.: unauthorized use of your access token or password leak), you will need to revoke all existing access tokens manually (see methods available above).","title":"Authentication"},{"location":"api/authentication/#authentication","text":"This guide covers details about authenticating (logging in to FreeFlarum settings) via FreeFlarum's API , not Flarum .

Agreement \u2693\ufe0e By creating your forum at FreeFlarum, you agree with these Terms & Conditions. Forums that do not comply with these terms may be suspended (either with or without prior notice) by FreeFlarum at its sole discretion. 2. Privacy Policy \u2693\ufe0e This document does not cover FreeFlarum's privacy policy. For reference, please view FreeFlarum's Privacy Policy . 3. COPPA \u2693\ufe0e If you are under the age of 13 without having your parent's/legal guardian's consent, per the requirements of COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), you can't use the FreeFlarum service. 4. Forum content \u2693\ufe0e All users of your FreeFlarum forum (including you) mustn't share forum content that falls into one or more of the following categories: Content deemed illegal, per your state/local laws & regulations; Personal attacks, harassment, absuvie or hate speech, bullying or otherwise attacking someone based on their gender, race, social or religious beliefs, sexual orientation, etc.; \"NSFW\"/\"NSFL\" content (pornography/heavy nudity, \"gore\", heavy/excessive profanity, etc.); \"Warez/cracked/pirated\" internet content sharing; Multi-level marketing schemes; Anything else that could be viewed as inappropriate for someone's well-being. 5.

We are a free and community provided service and we are not looking towards becoming a commercial entity. Getting profit from something that is provided for free is not very nice either.

For bugs and vulnerabilities related to the Flarum software, please refer to Flarum's GitHub issues page . If you believe that a certain forum hosted at FreeFlarum is violating these terms, contact us . Fair Use Policy \u2693\ufe0e 1. Limits \u2693\ufe0e As an ever-growing, free service, FreeFlarum reserves the right to impose certain limits related to its forums' storage space, user limit and other metrics, to ensure its stability and availability for everyone. FreeFlarum isn't recommended for big forums. FreeFlarum's main goal is to help you start from zero. Specifically, this means that FreeFlarum does not currently support more than 50 active visitors at the same time. This limit is not enforced. You will be notified via E-mail if your forum reaches more than 1 000 (offline) users, 5 000 discussions or 10 000 posts, which FreeFlarum considers to be \"very active\". 2. Inactive/too active forums \u2693\ufe0e FreeFlarum checks for inactive/way too active forums every 3 months. Inactive are forums that have existed for at least 1 month and haven't had any new users or posts for that month (or simply have less than 2 posts, regardless of other factors). Too active , are forums that have more than 20 000 (offline) users, 20 000 discussions or 35 000 posts (exceptions can be made based on certain criteria and/or rare edge cases). Forums that match one of these criteria are archived by FreeFlarum. If that happens, you will be notified via E-mail that you entered when registering your forum. Inactive forums can be reactivated for 6 months before they are fully erased from FreeFlarum (too active forums are not eligible for reactivation, because big forums are problematic for FreeFlarum ). If your forum was archived, please contact me and I will reactivate it for you, or alternatively send you an E-mail with your data, if that's still possible. These limits may be surpassed and your forum can function properly, however FreeFlarum does not officially provide support for forums above these limits regarding their functionality - in other words, if you want to run a busy forum, your best option might be to self-host it instead or switch to a solution such as Blomstra , as FreeFlarum is not built, nor intended for large forums.

FreeFlarum isn't recommended for big forums. FreeFlarum's main goal is to help you start from zero. Specifically, this means that FreeFlarum does not currently support more than 50 active visitors at the same time. This limit is not enforced. You will be notified via E-mail if your forum reaches more than 1 000 (offline) users, 5 000 discussions or 10 000 posts, which FreeFlarum considers to be \"very active\".","title":"1. Limits"},{"location":"legal/terms/#2-inactivetoo-active-forums","text":"FreeFlarum checks for inactive/way too active forums every 3 months. Inactive are forums that have existed for at least 1 month and haven't had any new users or posts for that month (or simply have less than 2 posts, regardless of other factors). Too active , are forums that have more than 20 000 (offline) users, 20 000 discussions or 35 000 posts (exceptions can be made based on certain criteria and/or rare edge cases). Forums that match one of these criteria are archived by FreeFlarum. If that happens, you will be notified via E-mail that you entered when registering your forum. Inactive forums can be reactivated for 6 months before they are fully erased from FreeFlarum (too active forums are not eligible for reactivation, because big forums are problematic for FreeFlarum ). If your forum was archived, please contact me and I will reactivate it for you, or alternatively send you an E-mail with your data, if that's still possible. These limits may be surpassed and your forum can function properly, however FreeFlarum does not officially provide support for forums above these limits regarding their functionality - in other words, if you want to run a busy forum, your best option might be to self-host it instead or switch to a solution such as Blomstra , as FreeFlarum is not built, nor intended for large forums.
